# stockstop-web-app
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### How to Run:
In the project directory, you will first need to run:

#### `npm install`

This will install the required dependencies for the project (in a folder called `node_modules`). Then, you need to run:

#### `npm start`

This should open the project in a browser window. If a browser window does not automatically open, go to http://localhost:3000 to view the project.
